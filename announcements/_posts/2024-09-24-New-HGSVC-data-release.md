The Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) have constructed and analysed complete haplotype sequences, including fully resolved centromeres and segmental duplications, from 65 individuals of diverse ancestries. This forms the first population-scale set of human genome assemblies resolved to near T2T completeness. This work is described in [Complex genetic variation in nearly complete human genomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.24.614721v1) by Logsdon, Ebert, Audano, Loftus et al.

More information and links to data are available on the [HGSVC3 page](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/hgsvc3).
