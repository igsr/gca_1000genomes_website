A new data collection and preprint describing structural variants from 1,019 samples from twenty-six 1000 Genomes Project populations is available. 

[Long-read sequencing and structural variant characterization in 1,019 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.18.590093) by Schloissnig,et al uses intermediate-level long read sequencing and a novel method integrating linear and graph based calling methods to type over 160,000 structural variants in this population scale catalogue.
