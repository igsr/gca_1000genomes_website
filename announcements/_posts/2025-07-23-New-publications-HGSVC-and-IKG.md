[Complex genetic variation in nearly complete human genomes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09140-6) by Logsdon, G.A., et al describes an extensive catalog of variation from the near complete assemblies of 65 human genomes from diverse 1000 Genomes Project samples. These high quality assemblies enable a more comprehensive insight into all variant types, including those within complex regions. 

Data is available via the [HGSVC3](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/hgsvc3) collection.

[Structural variation in 1,019 diverse humans based on long-read sequencing](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09290-7) by Schloissnig, S et al describes the characterisation of structural variants in 1019 samples from 26 different the 1000 Genomes Project populations. This study used intermediate-coverage long read sequencing and a novel integration of linear and graph genome-based analyses. 

Data is available via the [1KG_ONT_VIENNA](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/1kg_ont_vienna) collection.
