This study advances SV characterization by integrating linear and graph based calling methods to create the first population-scale catalogue of SVs using long-reads. 

1,019 samples from twentysix 1000 Genomes Project populations were sequenced to intermediate coverage using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Linear and graph-based approaches for SV analysis were integrated via pangenome graph-augmentation, to uncover 167,291 sequence-resolved SVs, 164,571 of which were successfully phased.
